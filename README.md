Behold: My new exploit! All-Xtensionkill!

***REMOVE EXTENSIONS***
1.Go to
```
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/disable-all-extensions/ailfldpmpboolaihojfagmmfbhcgohne
```
and see if you are allowed to install it.
If yes,then your problems are solved.
If not...then you may have to take the risk of many 
more steps.

***DELETE-BROWSER EXPLOIT***
2.Drag
```
chrome://flags
```
into your bookmarks bar.
If ou do not have a bookmarks bar,try
Control+Shift+B.
Click the bookmarklet.Just once! (Chuckle)
After that,there should be a button that says ***Reset all***
Click it! 

*****REBOOT*****
3.Do Control+Alt+T
To launch crosh.
If you do not want to use crosh,
use Linux or Terminal or Whatever...
Type in either
```
Rollback/Reboot_Linux|Sudo apt update/Sudo apt upgrade.js/"open-file"
```

(More coming soon,for now,all I can do is paste this filesystem URL,and apply give you  this link!)

```
filesystem:chrome-extension://ailfldpmpboolaihojfagmmfbhcgohne/temporary/isolation.html
```

```
chrome://flags/#install-isolated-web-app-from-url
```
